- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabricio Oliveira
- 👀 I'm interested in coding challenges in general. I love coding and learning new things. My current favorite programming language is JavaScript, but I also enjoy tackling coding challenges in several other languages such as Go, Elixir, Python, and TypeScript.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Google Cloud Platform (GCP). I have a strong knowledge of AWS and its main services such as EC2, S3, ECS, DynamoDB, and RDS, among others. Now, I am expanding my knowledge and exploring the GCP services to further enhance my skills.
